# Custom React App Template

## Introduction

Welcome to the Custom React App Template! This project provides a versatile template for building React applications, featuring a custom configuration setup that allows developers to easily adapt and extend their projects according to specific requirements.

## Features

- **Modern React 18 Framework**: Harness the full potential of React 18, offering the latest features and optimizations for a superior development experience.

- **TypeScript 5 Integration**: Utilize the power and flexibility of TypeScript 5, providing strong typing and advanced features for more robust and maintainable code.

- **React Router DOM 6**: Implement the latest version of React Router, enabling dynamic and efficient routing throughout your application with its powerful features and improved API.

- **Material-UI (MUI) for React**: Leverage the preinstalled Material-UI, a comprehensive suite of UI tools, to create visually appealing and highly functional interfaces with minimal effort.

- **Notistack Integration**: Enjoy the convenience of Notistack, a snack bar notification library that works seamlessly with Material-UI, enhancing user experience with customizable and dismissible alerts.

- **SASS for Styling**: Utilize the power of SASS, a preprocessor scripting language, to write more maintainable and scalable CSS for your app.

- **Lint-Staged for Better Code Quality**: Employ lint-staged to run ESLint checks on staged git files, ensuring that your codebase remains clean and consistent.

- **ESLint for Code Consistency**: Incorporate ESLint, a static code analysis tool, to automatically identify and fix problems in your JavaScript/TypeScript code, promoting best practices and reducing bugs.

- **Prettier for Code Formatting**: Integrate Prettier, an opinionated code formatter, to automatically format your code for consistency and readability, harmonizing the style across your entire codebase.

This template sets the stage for a highly efficient, maintainable, and scalable React application development, combining the best tools and practices in the industry.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
2. `yarn install` Install dependencies using Yarn:
3. `yarn run prepare` Prepare the project (sets up Husky for hooks):
4. `yarn run start` Start the development server (development mode with webpack):
   This will execute the command: `cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack serve`
5. `yarn run build` To build the project for production:
   This will execute the command: `cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack`
6. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser.
